# Research Project Assessment

**This assessment is for the final research project only.** Use the `assessment.md` file for all mini-projects.


## Instructions

Before submitting your research project draft for grading, confirm:

1. The manuscript .qmd for your project is in the root directory and knits to .pdf without error.
2. The knitted .pdf of your draft is in the root directory, with the same filename as the .qmd.
3. This `research-assessment.md` file is in the root directory of your project repo.
4. Dr. Dowling and your section TA are collaborators on your GitHub repo with permissions to pull/push.

To complete this assessment:

1. Complete the basic information section in full. 
2. Confirm all links are correct and accessible
3. Check off all objectives you are attempting to demonstrate
    1. To earn 30 points you must demonstrate each objective. However, you do not need to attempt all objectives with each draft if your goal is to build the project over time.
    2. If the objective is demonstrated somewhere other than the .qmd, add a note in the grader comments section for where to find it (e.g., "see `data-cleaning.R` lines 20-30").
4. Optionally, complete the reflection section, which may earn engagement points.

## Overall requirements

Overall requirements for the research project are as follows:

1. The project must be a research project. It must provide background on a research topic, ask at least one research question, use data to attempt to answer that question, report the results of the data analysis, and interpret the results in the context of the research question.
2. The project must be contained in a github repository that follows git best practices and includes all necessary files to run the project from start to finish, including:
    1. The .qmd file for the manuscript
    2. All data files used in the project
    3. All scripts used in the project
    4. A README.md file & .gitignore file
3. The project must be reproducible -- a reader should be able to clone the repo and run the .qmd from start to finish without error. The .qmd file should include:
    1. A YAML header with all fields necessary for an APA manuscript
    2. Setup source chunks that load libraries, read in data, set chunk options, set seed, etc.
    3. Minimally, an IMRD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion), though it may be more complex
    4. Integration of markdown and code chunks throughout, following best practices for using code chunks
    5. Figures and tables rendered in code chunks
    6. Inline R code & references to render data-dependent text
    7. At least 1 descriptive analysis and 1 hypothesis test, either in code chunks or sourced scripts
    8. Frequent and informative code comments throughout
4. The .qmd file should knit/render to an APA7 formatted manuscript with one click and no errors. The knitted manuscript should include:
    1. A title page with title, author, and institutional affiliation
    2. An abstract (this may be minimal, but should exist)
    3. Narrative text comprising a complete research report
    4. APA7 references, both in-text citations and a References page
    5. Publication-ready figures (2+) and tables (1+)
    6. Results of all analyses presented in-text (and where appropriate, in tables), with no raw R output; where possible, all text should be data-dependent and rendered with inline R code
    7. Quarto generated references to all figures and tables
    8. Statistical analyses and figures interpreted in narrative text
5. The .qmd should render a .pdf identical to the .pdf you submit for grading


## Assessment

The final project must demonstrate each of 30 the course learning objectives, each worth 1 point. 

Below each learning objective is a list of general expectations for meeting that objective. You should aim to meet all expectations to earn a point for meeting the objective, but these are not rigid requirements. For example, writing a complex and creative function that uses multiple arguments and returns a complex output could meet the "parse and define functions and arguments" objective, even if it is only used in one context.

Refer to the website for general tips on meeting these objectives and an FAQ.
