# Objective tracker

This document tracks your progress meeting 20 unique objectives across all mini-projects. When you are attempting to meet an objective not already checked off here, you should indicate that on your assessment. If your grader gives you the point for that objective, they will check it off here and update your total points in this category on Canvas.

**DO NOT EDIT THIS DOCUMENT.** Remember that by using GitHub everyone can see the history of this document, so we can see who checked off each objective and when. If you accidentally edit this, revert to the previous version and email Dr. Dowling and your section TA to let them know. Students who make edits to this document without reverting changes will receive a 0 of 20 for this category of points.
